A terminal based application allowing the user to save and load custom calendars.

Note: The alignment of the display is disrupted by a terminal with low width, any issues with the terminal visualization are likely due to the width of the window being too small.

Running: Run main.py to run the Calendar

Saving: The Calendar files will be saved to the same directory containing main.py
